# Project Showcase: Blockchain Dashboard

1.  Objective:
    
    This project aims to assess your skills in building a user-friendly and informative blockchain dashboard using Next.js and a CSS framework of your choice. You will demonstrate your ability to fetch and display relevant data from a public blockchain, implement unit tests, and document your development process.
    
2.  Project Requirements:
    
    *   Technology Stack:
        
        *   Frontend Framework: Next.js
        *   CSS Framework: Choose any CSS framework you are comfortable with (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI)
        *   Testing Framework: Implement unit tests using a suitable testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)

    *   Blockchain Network and Data:
        
        *   Select a public blockchain network of your choice (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia testnet, Linea, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.)
        *   Identify and display relevant information about past blocks on the chosen network. This could include:
            *   Block height
            *   Timestamp
            *   Number of transactions
            *   Gas used (avg, total, variation, etc)
            *   Miner/validator information
            *   Any other data you find interesting or insightful

    *   Dashboard Design and Functionality:
        
        *   Design a clean and intuitive user interface for the dashboard
        *   Implement features to allow users to view relevant blockchain data, for example:
            *   View a list of past blocks
            *   Filter or sort blocks based on specific criteria
            *   View detailed information about individual blocks
            *   View charts and lists

    *   Unit Testing:
        
        *   Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and correctness of your components and data fetching logic

    *   Documentation:
        
        *   Document your project clearly, explaining your design choices, implementation details, and testing approach

    *   Version Control:
        
        *   Use Git for version control and commit your code frequently to showcase your development process

3.  Evaluation Criteria:
    
    *   Code quality and adherence to best practices
    *   UI/UX design and user-friendliness
    *   Functionality and data accuracy
    *   Testing coverage and effectiveness
    *   Documentation clarity and completeness
    *   Version control history and commit messages
